2Performance improvements
3)Various fix

Version 5.0 is not backward compatible

Version 4.2:
Performance improvements.

Version 4.1:
1) koblitzâ€™s algorithm now support all prime number

Version 4.0:
1) hexadecimal encode for std_curves
2) new test module: automatic test for arithmetic, representation and built-in algorithm
3) new package organization: the most important features are directly accessible from ECL namespace
4) new package public interface: import* import only essential names
5) immutability for Curve and Point: methods that change the state are now protected, members are now private with read-only property
6) type annotation

Version 4 is not backward compatible
