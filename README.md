# EllipticCurvesLibrary
Python implementation of Elliptic Curves Criptography

The library includes:

    -the classes Curve, Point and Point with order
    -basic operations
    -El Gamal's cipher
    -Koblitz algorithm
    -Diffie-Hellman's Protocol 
    -ECDSA signature algorithm
    -NIST standard prime curves
    
Language Version
The library is written using python 3.5, earlier versions of python 3 may be compatible, but there is no guarantee.
